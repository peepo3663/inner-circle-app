## Introduction

### Wasupol Tungsakultong

My name is Wasupol Tungsakultong, I have experience in Software Development for 6 years, as mobile developer 5 years, as backend developer for 3 years and as frontend developer for 3 years. I think I would like to call myself as `Full-stack developer` in my last 3 years before joinning Boston University. I love technologies and love dogs. I pet 2 toy poodles and they are lovely and friendly to everyone.

### Peter Lake

My name is Peter. I do not have software development experience outside of acting as the client and testing as an end user in some projects at work. My programming experience has been mostly from classes; I started studying CS by completing the BU MET CS undergraduate certificate (using Java). Since then I have worked with Python, R and SQL. I like to travel especially to visit museums and breweries... so it hasn't been a fun year.  

### Raef Youssef

My name is Raef. I like to identify myself as a data scientist and a tech enthusiast. I do not come from software development background, but was always interested in the subject. I first learned coding when I was 12 and it was Visual Basic. I know a bit about CGI, data and coding, and I hope that someday to combine all three in a project. Something like a digital twin for a smart city.

### Michael Ranasinghe

My name is Michael Ranasinghe. I did my bachelor's in biomedical engineering, and for about the past 2 years have worked as a programmer at Mass Gen. I'm pretty familiar in C++, Python, and MATLAB (it would be a cardinal sin to be unfamiliar with the language, since it is heavily used in the biomedical community). I have a golden retriever, whose name is Henry :). In my free time, I enjoy to run and develop new apps!

### Ananya Sharma

I am Ananya Sharma, this is my second year of MS in Computer Science with concentration in Data Analytics. I was previously working as a Product Specialist at S&P Global before joining school full-time. I love working/learning Machine Learning concepts. I am looking forward on building an application and I think this experience will provide us with the exposure to real-world software engineering process.

### Jian Ma

My name is Jian Ma and I was born and raised in China. I am a graduate student in computer science. The only large collaborative software projects that I have worked on was an Android application called MusicMoji. Basically, it search the lyrics of the song you are playing and translates the lyrics to emoji. It is a fun, entertaining, and pretty useful application. I am looking forward to working closely with my group to produce a high-quality software system. I am a great communicator and I enjoys working with others to solve problems.
