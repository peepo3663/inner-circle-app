## Introduction

### Wasupol Tungsakultong

My name is Wasupol Tungsakultong, I have experience in Software Development for 6 years, as mobile developer 5 years, as backend developer for 3 years and as frontend developer for 3 years. I think I would like to call myself as `Full-stack developer` in my last 3 years before joinning Boston University. I love technologies and love dogs. I pet 2 toy poodles and they are lovely and friendly to everyone.

### Peter Lake

My name is Peter. I do not have software development experience outside of acting as the client and testing as an end user in some projects at work. My programming experience has been mostly from classes; I started studying CS by completing the BU MET CS undergraduate certificate (using Java). Since then I have worked with Python, R and SQL. I like to travel especially to visit museums and breweries... so it hasn't been a fun year.  

### Raef Youssef

My name is Raef. I like to identify myself as a data scientist and a tech enthusiast. I do not come from software development background, but was always interested in the subject. I first learned coding when I was 12 and it was Visual Basic. I know a bit about CGI, data and coding, and I hope that someday to combine all three in a project. Something like a digital twin for a smart city.
