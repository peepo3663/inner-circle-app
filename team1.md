## Introduction

### Wasupol Tungsakultong

My name is Wasupol Tungsakultong, I have experience in Software Development for 6 years, as mobile developer 5 years, as backend developer for 3 years and as frontend developer for 3 years. I think I would like to call myself as `Full-stack developer` in my last 3 years before joinning Boston University. I love technologies and love dogs. I pet 2 toy poodles and they are lovely and friendly to everyone.

### Peter Lake

My name is Peter. I do not have software development experience outside of acting as the client and testing as an end user in some projects at work. My programming experience has been mostly from classes; I started studying CS by completing the BU MET CS undergraduate certificate (using Java). Since then I have worked with Python, R and SQL. I like to travel especially to visit museums and breweries... so it hasn't been a fun year.
