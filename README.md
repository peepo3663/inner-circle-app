###Ananya Sharma

I am Ananya Sharma, this is my second year of MS in Computer Science with concentration in Data Analytics. I was previously working as a Product Specialist at S&P Global before joining school full-time. I love working/learning Machine Learning concepts. I am looking forward on building an application and I think this experience will provide us with the exposure to real-world software engineering process.# CS673F20T1
